# mvvm-demo
This's easy demo app that use a MVVM pattern

This app has essentially two controllers. In the first **"ListTableViewController"** there is a list of objects that you can buy and you can set the amount you want. In the next Controller **"CheckOutViewController"**, you have the total cost, plus the possibility of converting it to more than 100 currencies.
